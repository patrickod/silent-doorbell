# WUPHF

WUPHF is a small notification service that is used in combination with
[earl](https://github.com/hzeller/rfid-access-control/tree/master/software/earl)
to allow people in [Noisebridge](https://noisebridge.net) to temporarily have
doorbell notifications sent to them by SMS and Slack in place of a bell ringing
in the physical space.

## What's with the name?

WUPHF is named in honor of Ryan Howard's startup in
[The Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WUPHF.com). WUPHF is a service
through which you receive notifications on every device known to man from
someone sending you a single WUPHF.
